<ul>
  <li>One of the primary goal for LSST (when it is designed) is to constrain cosmological parameters through weak lensing and angular clustering of galaxies. But now we know that LSST can do much more. LSST contains two modes: Wide-Fast-Deep (WFD) survey which will cover ~18,000 square degrees in its 10-year nominal period with <script type="math/tex">ugrizy</script> bands and has detection depth of 27.5 mag in <script type="math/tex">r</script>-band. It also has four (or more) Deep Drilling Fields (DDF) with 9.6 square degrees FoV (single frame) and 28.5 mag depth. DDF will probably pointed to several famous spots such as COSMOS or XMM-LSS. LSST will release its Prompt data products daily and release Data Release products yearly, containing single image, codas, and catalogs (photo-z, forward-modeled flux).</li>
  <li>Using LSST data, galaxy astronomers can do a lot of things. We could measure the stellar mass better and understand galaxy outskirts better using deep stacked images from LSST. We could employ the weak lensing techniques to measure the dark matter halo mass so that stellar mass - halo mass connection could be constrained better and deeper. By comparing the luminosity functions, stellar-halo connections and spatial clustering observed by LSST with theoretical results, the physics of galaxy formation and evolution will no longer be concealed behind the dark universe. This challenges simulations and computational power. Current hydro-sims are typically in small volumes and don’t cover a wide enough range of environments and peak rarity. LSST will find more than <script type="math/tex">10^7</script> quasars, contributing to the studies of coevolution between SMBH and host galaxy, and the growth mechanisms of SMBH as well.Deep images of LSST will also give rise to the study of low surface brightness features: ICL, UDG/UFG, tidal debris, etc. LSST could reach ~30 mag/arcsec2 after stacking 10-year imaging data.</li>
  <li>Challenges: LSST faces multiple challenges especially on technical level. How to ensure the image quality during 10-year long run? How to store and reduce images quickly and with high fidelity as well? How to deb lend objects and apply accurate photometry? ……</li>
  <li>LSST will be better with the synergy of ancillary data bases (in other wavelengths). Together with spectroscopic projects (MOON, PFS, DESI) and space-based projects (EUCLID, WFIRST), LSST could contribute to the astronomy community with high quality data and enormous sciences.</li>

<dd>NGC 5907 in the eye of Dragonfly</dd>
</dl>

<p>Pieter van Dokkum今天发了挺有意思的一篇小文章。NGC 5907是一个挺近 (17 Mpc) 的侧向 (edge-on) 星系，1998年一位中国天文学家用北京天文台的0.6/0.9m施密特望远镜发现了这个星系周围环绕着的<em>一圈</em>疑似潮汐瓦解遗迹的低面亮度特征<a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/311563">🔗</a>。而后这个星系又被很多人观测过，其中一位叫做Martínez- Delgado的业余天文学家在2008年也用他0.5m的RC望远镜拍了这个星系<a href="https://www.cosmotography.com/images/small_ring_ngc5907.html">🔗</a> - <a href="https://www.cosmotography.com/images/ngc5907_confirmation.html">🔗</a>，但是他们发现了两个“环”。十年过去了，Pieter van Dokkum领导的Dragonfly团队（就是发现缺少暗物质的星系的那个）又重新拍摄了这个星系，基本确认了NGC 5907在 29 mag/arcsec2 以上只有一个长长的右尾巴和一个90度拐角的左尾巴。而且Martínez- Delgado图中第一条”尾巴“的位置也跟Dragonfly和北京天文台拍的对不上。那么问题来了：到底是Dragonfly错了，还是那位业余天文学家错了呢？😏</p>

<p>这些痕迹的面亮度都非常暗（27-29 mag/arcsec2)，Dragonfly望远镜对“尾巴”细节的精确捕捉正体现出了Dragonfly对于探测低面亮度细节的强大威力。Dragonfly现在正在进行wide field巡天，而我也在写帮助他们更容易低面亮度特征的代码，期待以后会有更多有意思的发现。</p>

  <li>
    <p>Introduction</p>

    <ul>
      <li>GW170817 (double NS) provides clues for the formation of elements heavies than iron (gold and platinum observed in the spectrum). It is also accompanied by a short GRB.
     - GW only transfers very small amount of energy, hence it can penetrate very dense matter field.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Long story short</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The maximum observed NS is 2.1 solar mass. How did they form if single degenerate SN model is correct and Chandrasekhar is total right.</li>
      <li>NS is not totally made of neutron. It has lighter elements and iron (predominate) on the surface, and then heavier elements with more neutron, and then compact exotic matter (strange quark matter? <a href="http://www.phy.pku.edu.cn/~xurenxin/index.html">@xrx</a>) The EoS of NS has not been understood yet.</li>
      <li>A rotating BH comes from stellar collapse which has non-zero angular momentum before collapsing. There are many problems related to BH which remain mysteries now: mass function, mid-mass BH, etc.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ground-based laser interferometers</p>

    <ul>
      <li>After the failure of Weber bar and knowing that strain from astronomical events is of magnitude of <script type="math/tex">h\sim 10^{-22}</script>, people began to build interferometers, including LIGO (USA, 4-km), Virgo (France and Italy, 3-km) and GEO (UK and Germany). More will be built in the near future (LISA, Tianqin, DECIGO, etc.)</li>
      <li>The interferometers are set up to make the interference destructive at the photodetector. Note that interferometer is only sensible to strain (<script type="math/tex">h\sim 1/r</script>), not to radiation power (<script type="math/tex">P\sim1/r^2</script>).</li>
      <li>LIGO is built to be sensitive in 20-20000 Hz, the noises are dominated by seismic on low-frequency end and quantum effects on high-frequency end.</li>
      <li>Optical system makes use of “Fabry-Perot cavities” to increase the distance light travels and “power recycling mirrors” to increase the power of laser light. LIGO uses 1064 nm infrared laser with ~40 W power. Mirrors are well designed, they only absorb one photon out of 300,000 photons, avoiding mirror heating, which could change the shapes of mirrors.</li>
      <li>The test masses are suspended by a passive damping system. LIGO also uses active (and kind of adaptive) damping system to fight against human-generated vibrations.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Double BH merger: GW150914</p>

    <ul>
      <li>GW150914 is the first GW event detected by human!! A brand new era of astrophysics started!</li>
      <li>LIGO people generate 250000 templates based on post-Newtonian and numerical relativity to fit the detected signals. Templates range from 1 solar mass to 90 solar masses. The S/N of GW150914 is 24.</li>
      <li>Based on Newtonian mechanics, during the inspiral process, we could estimate the chirp mass by <script type="math/tex">\omega</script> and <script type="math/tex">\dot{\omega}</script>. And it turns out <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{M} \sim 30 M_\odot</script>. The coalescence stage begins when the Schwarzchild radius of two BHs contact with each other. For GW150914 the coalescence begins at <script type="math/tex">\nu\sim 330\ \text{Hz}</script>, so the total mass of two BHs can be estimated <script type="math/tex">M\sim 70 M_\odot</script>. Given chirp mass and total mass, the mass of two BH can be worked out:  <script type="math/tex">m_1^{obs} = 42M_\odot,\ m_2^{obs} = 28 M_\odot</script>.</li>
      <li>The flux and total luminosity of binary BH merger can be given by GR. Hence we could derive the luminosity distance for this event <script type="math/tex">D_L = 400\ \text{Mpc}</script>. If we know the redshift (say from possible EM counterpart), we could yield a Hubble constant. Also, given this luminosity distance and LCDM cosmology, the redshift <script type="math/tex">z\sim 0.1</script>. Notice that cosmological effects (redshift and time dilution) affect the measurement of mass. In source coordinate, the mass is <script type="math/tex">m = m^{obs} / (1+z)</script>.</li>
      <li>GW150914 emits 4 solar mass energy within a tenth of second, however our sun emits 0.01 solar mass in 10 Gyr.</li>
      <li>After the ringdown process, a Kerr BH will be formed. Notice that a Kerr BH has smaller horizon area than a Schwarzchild BH of the same mass. Hence Kerr BH is more compact. The study of Kerr BH after ringdown could give us insights to strong field regime of gravity and further inspection of the validity of GR.</li>
      <li>The sky location resolution of LIGO is <script type="math/tex">\Delta \theta = \lambda / L \sim 28^{\circ}</script> for this event.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>GW170817, GRB170817A, AT 2017gfo</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Respectively - the GW event, the gamma-ray burst 1.7 s later, the afterglow in different wavelengths (kilonova).</li>
      <li>GW170817 - toward the end of the data run of O2 of aLIGO and aVirgo
        <ul>
          <li>NS binary - produce a GW signal observable by <strong>ground-based</strong> detectors in the final minutes before the massive objects collide.
            <ul>
              <li>Detection rate for advanced detectors (per year) - $\mathcal{O}(0.1)\sim\mathcal{O}(100)$ (astrophysical uncertainty).</li>
              <li>First indirect observation of GW - <strong>the Hulse and Taylor pulsar</strong>.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Position localization - 28 deg$^2$ (purely GW signal restriction).</li>
          <li>Again, the chirp mass $\mathcal{M}$ ($\sim1.1\ M_\odot$ in the source frame and $\mathcal{M}^{d e t}=1.1977 M_{\odot}$ in the detectors frame when $z=0.008$ which) and the radius $R$ of the system are directly determined by observed $\omega$ and $\dot\omega$ during the inspiral phase. The amplitude $h$ is $\sim10^{-22}$ so we can derive a luminosity distance and redshift, which are consistent with the known results of NGC 4993</li>
          <li>As $R$ approaches the size of the bodies, PN theory is no longer valid, relativistic effects related to the mass ratio $q=m_2/m_1$ (where $m_2&gt;m_1$) as well as spin-orbit and spin-spin couplings become more significant. The derived chirp mass $\mathcal{M}$ differs from values at early times, which means the details of the objects’ internal structure become important.</li>
          <li>Individual masses are more difficult to determined. By assuming high/low spins, the masses of both objects are approximately $1.4M_\odot$.</li>
          <li>The inclination of the system $\Theta \leq 28^{\circ}$.</li>
          <li>Tidal effects are important for NS binaries (not important for BHs because they are <strong>bald</strong> as astronomers always do) especially when the two objects get really close, which corresponds to a high frequency $\nu_{g w} \simeq 600\ \mathrm{Hz}$. This is at present too hard for a ground-base interferometer to achieve, but once it is detected, we would gain a better understanding of the EoS of a NS.</li>
          <li>The final state depends on individual masses. It can be a NS with a torus, a supra-massive/hypermassive NS which turns into a BH with a torus soon, or directly a BH with a torus.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>GRB170817A - the prompt emission is attributed to internal energy dissipation inside a relativistic jet (<strong>relativistic expanding fireballs</strong>)
        <ul>

This challenges the formation theories of stellar mass BHs. We also observed a gap in the BH mass spectrum between 2.5 solar mass (below which are all neutron stars) and 5 solar mass. Also, we don’t find many intermediate-mass BHs.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>We have detected supermassive BHs and stellar-mass BHs. We found a SMBH with <script type="math/tex">M>10^9 M_\odot</script> at <script type="math/tex">z>7</script>. But we know nothing about how they form. The intermediate-mass BHs (<script type="math/tex">100 - 10^5\ M_\odot</script>) could serve as seeds for the formation of SMBH. We didn’t find any IMBH so far.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One speculation is that IMBH is in the center of GC. Taking the advantage of high resolution of next generation ground-based large telescopes (TMT, E-ELT), we could measure the proper motion of stars in the center of GCs at different epochs, then derive the mass of central BH. The existence of <script type="math/tex">10^3\ M_\odot</script> BH could increase the central velocity dispersion by 1 km/s.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another possibility is that IMBH is in the center of low-mass galaxies. Using IFU + adaptive optics on 8-10 meter telescopes, we have already made progress on the demography of SMBH. In the same way, we could measure the <script type="math/tex">\sigma^*</script> with much higher resolution for nearly all low-mass galaxies.</p>

<p>References: <a href="http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/users/kud/teaching_15/10_SBF.pdf">Lecture slides of <strong>Rolf Kudritzki</strong></a>; Chapter 4.2 of Richard de Grijs book.</p>

<p>We always (typically) use ETG to measure surface brightness fluctuations. (Any chance that we can use UDG or disks? I remembered that one of Jenny Greene’s students wrote a paper about this.) We could resolve individual stars in M32, so the Surface Brightness (SB) is fluctuating across the image. It’s easy to understand that it would be very smooth if we put that galaxy to very far away.</p>

</dl>

<p>Given the luminosity function, we could divide stars in galaxy into several separated parts, hence <script type="math/tex">L = \sum n_iL_i</script>. Now we only focus on one part of them. Assuming the pixel scale is <script type="math/tex">\theta</script> on the sky, the distance is <script type="math/tex">d</script>, the column density of stars is <script type="math/tex">n_i</script>, thus the number of stars you see in each pixel is <script type="math/tex">N_i = n_i (d \theta )^2</script>.  The flux we received from these stars is</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">F_i = \frac{N_i L_i}{4\pi d^2} = \frac{n_i L_i \theta^2}{4\pi}=\mathrm{const.}</script>

<p>That is to say that surface brightness (often expressed in mag/arcsec^2) remains a constant, regardless of distance.</p>

<p>Assuming the Poissonian fluctuations of number of stars, we have: <script type="math/tex">\sigma_{F_i}/F_i = 1/\sqrt{N_i}</script>, thus</p>

<p><script type="math/tex">\frac{\sigma_{F_i}^2}{F_i} = \frac{F_i}{N_i} = \frac{L_i}{4\pi d^2} \propto \frac{1}{d^2}</script>.</p>

<p>We define the surface brightness fluctuation to be <script type="math/tex">\sigma_{F_i}^2/F_i</script>, it goes as <script type="math/tex">d^{-2}</script>.</p>

<p>If we consider all stellar populations: (note that <script type="math/tex">\sigma_{F_i} = \left(\frac{\theta}{4\pi d}\right)^2 n_i L_i^2</script> )</p>

<p><script type="math/tex">\sigma_F^2 = \sum \sigma_{F_i}^2 = \left(\frac{\theta}{4\pi d}\right)^2 \sum n_i L_i^2</script>,</p>

<p><script type="math/tex">F = \sum F_i = \frac{\theta^2}{4\pi} \sum n_i L_i</script>.</p>

<p>Thus <script type="math/tex">F_{SBF} = \frac{\sigma_F^2}{F} = \frac{1}{4\pi d^2}\frac{\sum n_i L_i^2}{\sum n_i L_i}</script>. As long we get <script type="math/tex">F_{SBF}</script> for two galaxies with almost the same stellar population, we could derive the distances ratio of these two galaxies using SBF method. However, the calibration is not trivial.</p>

<p>How to measure the SBF? For an elliptical galaxy, first you need to fit a overall (2-D) model for the smoothed light distribution. After subtracting this model from image, the fluctuation is left. You can also normalize the fluctuation and mask out contaminations (see lower-right panel). Then you need to apply Fourier transformation to the image and derive a power spectrum. It will look like:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">|I(k)|^2 = \sigma_{SBF}^2 P_{\mathrm{PSF}}^2(k) + \mathrm{const.}</script>

<p>The PSF term is easy to understand, since the pixels within the FWHM of PSF is kind of correlated. The constant term comes from the random fluctuations from sky, ccd bad pixels, cosmic rays, etc. (since the modulus of Fourier transform of a delta function if a constant). In the following figure, upper panel is M32 at 8 Mpc, where lower panel is NGC 3379 at 10 Mpc. The declining dashed line shows the power spectrum of PSF. Comparing both panels, the effect of <script type="math/tex">\sigma_{SBF}^2</script> is significant, making it the good tool to indicate distance for nearby elliptical galaxies.</p>

<h3 id="csst-workshop">CSST Workshop</h3>

<p>The following is from the presentation of Luis Ho.</p>

<p>CSS will be launched in 2022, three astronauts living in orbit. Tiangong station has 39 boxes, only one of those boxes is used in applied sciences. CSST will be launched in 2024.</p>

<p>If you mount the telescope onto to space station, the vibration will decrease the image quality. Brilliant idea: fly the telescope in the same orbit, so that the telescope could be mounted into the CSS anytime, making changing instruments and repairs possible and feasible.</p>

<p>Europe will launch Euclid (2.4m, PSF = 2 arcsec), aiming at cosmology and weak lensing. US is also considering launch WFIRST (near IR), the future of it is not clear.</p>

<p>On the ground, we will have LSST (8m), survey in time domain. LSST and CSST is complimentary, CSST will have higher resolution.</p>

<p>Optical design: 离轴三反 (clear PSF, good for weak lensing).  It has almost the same number of pixels as LSST camera (largest one ever built).</p>

<p>CSST Imaging: 17500 Wide mode, 255-1000nm, more than 6 filters (SED coverage, from near UV to J band), 0.15 arcsec seeing. CSST Spectroscopy: R&gt;200 (better than typical narrow band). “Huge area, large wavelength coverage”</p>

<p>Sciences: Cosmology (lensing, very good photo-zs, large scale structures), AGN/Galaxies, etc.</p>

<p>CSST is <script type="math/tex">7500\times 7</script> COSMOS (since COSMOS is only 1 square degree and is only in $i$ band.</p>

<p><strong>Problems</strong>: We don’t have a good team. (Euclid and WFIRST have big teams, complete docs).</p>

<p>“To the zero/first/second order, CSST = HST”. To do science, we don’t need 17500 deg^2. “LSST = HSC”.</p>

<p>“CSST + Euclid + WFIRST = CANDELS (many bands, near complete SED data)”</p>

<p>We can think about combining HSC data and their overlap with previous data.</p>

<p><strong>“What do you measure and how do you measure???”</strong> (Tidal tails, UDGs, meters, etc.)</p>

<p>Best way to prepare for CSST: the only driven source is to write papers and pipelines.</p>

    <p>Observations show that massive galaxies (region) are older, more metal-rich, more <script type="math/tex">\alpha</script>-enhanced compared to low-mass galaxies. They also have higher velocity dispersion in the center. We know that low-mass galaxies are possibly the building blocks of very massive galaxies. However, these building blocks have low metallicity and low <script type="math/tex">\alpha</script> abundance, thus they would dilute the metallicity and <script type="math/tex">\alpha</script> abundance of massive galaxies, making it a paradox. However, the relations between <script type="math/tex">M_*</script> and metallicity (<script type="math/tex">\alpha</script> abundance) have large scatter. There are some low-mass galaxies which are old, metal-rich and <script type="math/tex">\alpha</script>-enhanced. Hence it seems that massive galaxies are prone to gather their building blocks which have early truncated star formation and have high <script type="math/tex">\alpha</script> abundance. This assembly is called <strong>Coordinated Assembly</strong> of BCG by this paper.</p>

  <li>
    <p>This paper utilizes MUSE IFU data to explore chemical abundances and velocity dispersions in galaxy cluster Abell 3827.

So this paper proposes that the building blocks are <strong>environmentally quenched</strong>. The star formation (burst) before was short, and early???</p>

We already have an established relation between stellar mass and overall metallicity (MZR). More massive galaxy has higher metallicity. The metallicity of ICL here measured by MaNGA indicates that: if they comes from individual galaxies, they should come from dwarf galaxies with stellar mass <script type="math/tex">% <![CDATA[

<p>IMPORTANT for my paper!</p>
<ul>
  <li>People used BPT diagram to distinguish SF galaxies with AGN galaxies. But in the past, SDSS only uses single-fibre spectrum, whose aperture typically corresponds to several kpc (also considering seeing). But to confirm AGN, you need to zoom more in to the scale of ~ 100 kpc.</li>
  <li>“Heckman (1980) first presented a detailed study of LI(N)ER emission, arguing that LI(N)ERs could represent the low-luminosity extension of the Sy population. Studies of the central few parsecs in nearby galaxies (Ho, Filippenko &amp; Sargent 1997; Shields et al. 2007) demonstrate that LINER emission on those scales can be associated with nuclear accretion phenomena, in particular weak, radiatively inefficient AGNs (see for example the review from Ho 2008). “ But Belfiore argued that the H<script type="math/tex">\alpha</script> emission luminosity excited by pAGB stars can be equal to (or brighter than) that excited by LLAGN. So pAGB can be a strong candidate.</li>
  <li>The demarcation line between SF and Seyfert+LINER can be derived theoretically. Here we use Kauffmann 2003 and Kewley 2001 (dotted in my plot). “The [S II] BPT diagram is not affected by the N/O abun- dance ratio, and provides a cleaner separation within the ‘right-hand sequence’ between Sy and LIERs (Kewley et al. 2006)”. The demarcation line between Seyfert and LINER is from Kewley 2006.</li>
  <li>Stars in LINER region are typically older than other regions. Stars in LINER region with larger S[II]/H<script type="math/tex">\alpha</script> are older.</li>
  <li>cLIER: central (within one PSF at least) LIER (classified by S[II] BPT); eLIER: LIER extends to one PSF at least; Seyfert: AGN within PSF; Line-less: EW[H<script type="math/tex">\alpha</script>] &lt; 1 within $1 R_e$.</li>
  <li>More cLIER and more eLIER at high mass end, more SF at low mass end.</li>
  <li>They study H<script type="math/tex">\alpha</script> profile and EW profile. SF has high EW, eLIER has low EW, cLIER has low EW at center, and EW increases rapidly.</li>
  <li>cLIER and eLIER are supported by pAGB star because: 1. Old stellar population; 2. low EW and flat gradient. The gradients of ionization parameters also rules out AGN as sources of eLIER.</li>

  <li>D4000 data implies that LIER region has an average stellar population age ~ 5 Gyrs. Given that pAGB stars come to power 2 Gyrs after the last star formation event (Belfiore 2017), this paper supports the post AGB scenario.</li>

  <li>Just read this <a href="https://astrobites.org/2019/02/21/searching-for-gravitational-waves-from-binary-supermassive-black-holes-with-cosmic-lighthouses/">astrobite</a> on this paper.</li>
  <li>NANOGrav project provides another approach of detecting gravitational waves. LIGO (and other ground-based experiments) is sensitive to high-frequency GW (1-1000 Hz), which is usually excited by binary BH mergers or binary NS mergers. Pulsar timing array is sensitive to low-frequency GW (nano-Hz), usually excited by the merger of supermassive BHs which are the result of galaxy-galaxy mergers.</li>
  <li>(Submilimeter) Pulsar is the lighthouse in the universe. If the gravitational wave propagate in the direction from the pulsar to us, the period of pulsar will be slightly different. This paper analyzes the past 11-year data from 43 pulsars, and find no GW event above a certain strain.
    <blockquote>
      <p>We find that there are no SMBHBs with a chirp mass greater than <script type="math/tex">10^9</script> solar masses within a distance of 120 Mpc and none with chirp passes greater than <script type="math/tex">10^{10}</script> solar masses within 5.5 Gpc. Using this data set, the collaboration has determined that there are no SMBHBs in the Virgo Cluster with a chirp mass greater than <script type="math/tex">1.6 \times 10^9</script> solar masses emitting gravitational waves at a frequency of 9 nHz, which implies that none of the galaxies NGC 4472, NGC 4486, or NGC 4649 (which are all candidates for gravitational waves in the Virgo Cluster) could contain SMBHBs emitting gravitational waves in this frequency range.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The discovery of the first GW event is quite interesting and exciting. It’s worth noting that ‘inject’ events test the correct judgment of GW events.</li>
  <li>Unlike electromagnetic wave, which can be excited by electric dipole (one positive, one negative), the gravitational wave cannot be simply excited by a dipole, since there’s nothing with negative mass.</li>
  <li>Imagine we have two points A and B. We can only detect the transverse GW which is propagating perpendicular to A-B. Only this type of GW could stretch the distance between A and B. The best ‘ruler’ of measuring distance is light. The speed of light is constant and unaltered by a gravitational wave.</li>
  <li>Richard Feynmann designed a gedanken experiment to show that gravitational waves do carry energy. “I was surprised to find that a whole day of the conference was spent on this issue and that ‘experts’ were confused. That’s what happens when one is considering energy conservation tensors, etc. instead of questioning, can waves do work?”</li>
  <li>Joseph Weber designed the very first GW detector, names “Weber bar”. But limited by the suspension techniques and thermal noise isolation, Weber published wrong results of detections. This kind of intense GW comes from the central SMBH of milky way will make our galaxy disperse before we human beings exist.</li>

  <li>The coalescences between stellar mass black holes produces GW with the amplitude of <script type="math/tex">h = 10^{-21}</script>.</li>
  <li>In designing an interferometer to detect GW, the optimal size of the arms is one-forth of the GW wavelength. (100 Hz corresponds to 750 km) Rainer Weiss came up with the idea of building an interferometer to detect GW in an undergraduate seminar on GR in MIT.</li>
  <li>Prior to LIGO, German has constructed a 600-m interferometer called GEO-600 (1994), which contributed a lot to this industry. France and Italy also built VIRGO (2003) detector at the same time with LIGO.</li>
  <li>Weiss cooperated with Thorne and Drever (both from Caltech) on building LIGO at first, but difficulties emerged between Weiss and Drever. Latter Barish took the position of Drever and became the leader of LIGO. He founded the laboratory LIGo and scientific collaboration LIGO, separately.</li>
  <li>“Initial” LIGO runs from 2002 to 2010 but got no results. But right before the official run of “Advanced” LIGO, a GW from BH-BH merger was detected by aLIGO during an experimental run. After then, more and more GWs are detected by LIGO. Weiss, Thorne and Barish were awarded 2017 Nobel Prize in Physics. The new era has come.</li>

Now this paper suggest that the color of local environment of SNe (their surroundings) should also be considered as a factor of calibration. Redder color implies low SFR.

<p>Continued from the following paper, which says <script type="math/tex">r_{80}</script> may be related to galaxy halo. This paper studies this further and gets some interesting results. After reading this paper, I feel intensively that good science is linking difference fields. Dirac linked analytical mechanics (Poisson brackets) with quantum phenomena, then quantum mechanics was born. This paper superficially links the stellar mass - <script type="math/tex">r_{80}</script> size diagram with the well-known stellar mass - halo mass relation, and get some interesting (maybe wrong, maybe correct) results.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.05017v1">Miller et al. 2019</a> already shows that the stellar mass - <script type="math/tex">r_{80}</script> size diagram cannot tell the SF and passive galaxies apart. Fig. 1 shows that the median lines of stellar mass - <script type="math/tex">r_{80}</script> size diagram are like two pieces of power law. Then they fit this ‘broken power law’ and define the pivot mass <script type="math/tex">M_{p}</script>, where the line turns up a little bit.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then they find the pivot mass evolve with redshift significantly. The first slope (which is lower) changes slightly over redshift, but the second slope changes much. Actually the first slope (piece) is just composed of the passive galaxy branch, and the second slope (piece) is presented by SF galaxies.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most interestingly, they remind of the stellar mass - halo mass relation. If the x-axis is stellar mass and y-axis is halo mass, the SMHM relation resembles this stellar mass - size diagram in <script type="math/tex">r_{80}</script>. So what’s the physics behind this? First, the halo mass is proportional to the cubed virial radius <script type="math/tex">R_{vir}</script>. And if <script type="math/tex">r_{80}</script> is proportional to <script type="math/tex">R_{vir}</script>, then it’s reasonable that <script type="math/tex">r_{80}</script> is a proxy of halo mass. So they just fit this coefficient for the most nearby redshift bin and find <script type="math/tex">r_{80} = 0.047 R_{vir}</script>. Assuming this holds for all redshift ranges, they plot SMHM relation predicted by <script type="math/tex">r_{80}</script>, which is now a proxy of halo mass. They find it’s good to <script type="math/tex">z\sim 2</script>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In measuring the SMHM relation, there are many methods such as g-g lensing and clustering (which is more direct and more observational), abundance matching, and halo occupation distribution. But different methods gives different results and have different detection ability on redshift. They author also define a pivot masses for the SMHM relations and study their evolution. They don’t match with stellar mass - size one. So they suspect the intrinsic scatter may cause huge caveat when convert a halo-to-stellar relation to stellar-to-halo relation.</p>

<p>The classfication of galaxies can not only based on stellar mass - color diagram (also stellar mass - SFR diagram), bust also based on stellar mass - size diagram. In the past, people usually use the effective radius <script type="math/tex">r_{50}</script> as a proxy of galaxy size. (But I have been suspecting how well can <script type="math/tex">r_{50}</script> describe the size of a galaxy for a long time.) As a common sense, massive elliptical galaxies are more extended in the outskirts, but spirals are not. If we fit a galaxy using a single Sersic model, ellipticals tend to have larger Sersic index <script type="math/tex">n</script>. In this paper, Pieter and his collaborators check what would happen if we use <script type="math/tex">r_{20}</script> and <script type="math/tex">r_{80}</script> as proxies of galaxy sizes. And I remember that Sandy Faber talked about this quite a lot in a colloquium in KIAA.</p>
<ul>
  <li>This paper is quite straightforward. (But I didn’t dig deep into the sample selection part.) They find that if we use <script type="math/tex">r_{20}</script>, then using the stellar mass - size diagram can easily distinguish star-forming and passive galaxies apart. But using <script type="math/tex">r_{80}</script>, SF and passive behaves similarly.</li>
  <li>In this paper, authors use some new algorithms/terms in statistics: <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/diptest/">Hartigan’s dip test</a>; Gaussian mixture models; Bayesian information criterion; Ashman’s <script type="math/tex">D</script> parameter; Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. But actually these are also straightforward.</li>
  <li>They suspect <script type="math/tex">r_{20}</script> has something to do with star-forming / quenching. Since <script type="math/tex">r_{80}</script> is not very different between SF and passive galaxies, it may be related to the galaxy halo.</li>
  <li>Besides, I find that log-normal distribution is interesting, see this paper <a href="https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/51/5/341/243981">Log-normal distributions across the science: keys and clues</a>.</li>

<p>On how to measure the velocity dispersion directly from spectrum, I found a paper by Luis Ho in 2002: <a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/343840/pdf">A Study of the Direct Fitting Method for Measurement of Galaxy Velocity Dispersions</a>. The main idea in this paper is:</p>
<ul>
  <li>In measuring velocity dispersion, it’s convenient to use <script type="math/tex">x = \ln(\lambda)</script> scale, because <script type="math/tex">x' = \ln[\lambda(1+z)] = x + \ln(1+z) \approx x + z</script> for <script type="math/tex">z\ll 1</script>.</li>
  <li>Find some spectrums of stars as templates. They don’t have any velocity dispersions (or can be ignored).</li>
  <li>Assume the effect of velocity dispersion is Gaussian. Then, to get a dispersed spectrum, you should convolve the template with a Gaussian kernel with a given radius. Write this in maths, that is <script type="math/tex">T(x)]\otimes G(x, r)</script>.</li>
  <li>But we should consider that the featureless continuum components are different between template and galaxy. So we simply add a featureless continuum which is typically a straight line with <script type="math/tex">x = \ln(\lambda)</script> (in <script type="math/tex">\lambda</script> domain this is an exponential continuum). Hence: <script type="math/tex">[T(x)\otimes G(x, r)] + C(x)</script>.</li>
  <li>To compensate other effects such as reddening difference between template and galaxy, we multiply a low-order Legendre polynomial, then get the final model spectrum. That is:
<script type="math/tex">M(x) = \{[T(x)\otimes G(x, r)] + C(x)\}\sum_l P_l(x).</script></li>
  <li>Then we have several parameters, like Gaussian kernel radius, continuum straight line intercept and slope, and coefficients for every order Legendre polynomials. Note that in <script type="math/tex">\chi^2</script>, the error term contains the measurement error of galaxy spectrum, and error of template which is typically negligible. At last, let MCMC be. The radius of Gaussian kernel should be the velocity dispersion (need a conversion).</li>
</ul>

<p>Now for the NGC1052-DF2 case, Shany make a spectrum combining spectrums of all special region. And this spectrum has been broadened. Shany uses templates from two Global Clusters, say M3 and M13. The templates here has already been broadened by velocity dispersion (Gaussian). And we know the <script type="math/tex">\sigma</script> of two Gaussian obeys <script type="math/tex">\sigma_{\mathrm{star}}^2 = \sigma_{\mathrm{template}}^2 + \sigma_{\mathrm{measure}}^2</script>, where <script type="math/tex">\sigma_{\mathrm{star}}</script> is the velocity dispersion of DF2. So we can measure <script type="math/tex">\sigma_{\mathrm{measure}}</script> by the same method as stated above, and then get the velocity dispersion of DF2 <script type="math/tex">\sigma_{\mathrm{star}}</script>, which is <script type="math/tex">\sigma_{\mathrm{star}} = 8.4\pm2.1\ \mathrm{km
 s}^{-1}</script>.</p>

<p>How to calculate the dynamical mass given the velocity dispersion? I need to figure out.</p>

<p>Intrinsic shape or rotation axis (minor axis rotation.)</p>

<p>Kevin: it’s not necessarily weird that we detect a galaxy lacking dark matter in its central region. Given the large scatter of halo mass and halo concentration of a given stellar mass in the low-mass end, it’s probably that we just encountered a galaxy with low halo mass and low halo concentration.</p>
