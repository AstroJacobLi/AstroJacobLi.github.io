<p>Kinetic energy is <script type="math/tex">10^{51}</script> erg.</p>

<p>Radiation energy is <script type="math/tex">10^{49}</script> erg.</p>

<p>10000 km/s is the typical velocity for SN explosion.</p>

<p>Zwicky: pioneer of searching SN.</p>

<p>SN1987A: in LMC, but is type II.</p>

<p>Gravitational binding energy: <script type="math/tex">10^{53}</script> erg. Where has energy gone? Neutrino!</p>

<p>Neutrino energy: <script type="math/tex">10^{53}</script> erg.</p>

<p><strong>We still don’t know the explosion mechanism of CC SN</strong></p>

<p>Detection power: <script type="math/tex">A(\mathrm{m}^2)\times\Omega(\mathrm{deg}^2)</script>, and LSST stands out!</p>

<p>SNe Ia are the “main sequence” of SNe, they are regularity and continuous.</p>

<p>Type II and Type Ib/Ic trace star formation. Type Ia doesn’t depend on environment too much.</p>

<p>The light of SN comes from <script type="math/tex">^{56}\mathrm{Ni}</script> decay. Low luminosity Ia are from elliptical galaxies, on the contrast, Ia in spirals are more luminous. Every theory should be able to produce an order of magnitude difference of Nicole. 1991bg: low luminosity; 1991T: super luminosity.</p>

<p>We don’t know how to trigger the explosion. (Maoz et al., 2014 ARAA); Duran Kushnir, Boaz Katz, Dan Maoz</p>

<p>Try to find close WD pairs as SN progenitors: SPY survey.</p>

<p>Subo: major channel WD-WD direct collision. ~20% WD in triples can explain the major channel of SN Ia.</p>

<p>Long time to produce low mass WD, thus more sub luminous Ia in ETG.</p>

<p>Just explode: we only see photosphere, ejecta are optical thick. With time goes on, we see deeper into that. After months, the ejecta gets nearly transparent, and turns into nebular phase.</p>

<p>Smoking gun paper: using cobalt line and found bimodal velocity distribution. Two chunks of Ni56! Fraction: 3/20. But viewing angle should be taking into consideration!</p>

<p>Non-equal mass of WD pairs leads to blueshift-redshift of cobalt lines.</p>

<p>Ping’s new work: H<script type="math/tex">\alpha</script> line, thin, less than 200 km/s. Maybe Ia-CSM?</p>

  <li>We can estimate the SFR over the last <script type="math/tex">\sim 100</script> Myrs using core-collapse SNe rate. This is only the lower limit of SFR since there are more missed or failed CC-SNe that we didn’t see.</li>
  <li>Given a SFR and metallicity, one can calculate the FUV luminosity of a galaxy. After applying extinction (both from the foreground and intrinsic) corrections and comparing it with observation, a luminosity distance can be determined.</li>
  <li>The distance to SN is crucial for determining the intrinsic luminosity of it. Larger distance here implies brighter/more massive progenitors. Using the new distance, two events become normal and can be explained from stellar physics models. Distances should be paid attention to!</li>

<ul>
  <li>Just read this <a href="https://astrobites.org/2019/02/21/searching-for-gravitational-waves-from-binary-supermassive-black-holes-with-cosmic-lighthouses/">astrobite</a> on this paper.</li>
  <li>NANOGrav project provides another approach of detecting gravitational waves. LIGO (and other ground-based experiments) is sensitive to high-frequency GW (1-1000 Hz), which is usually excited by binary BH mergers or binary NS mergers. Pulsar timing array is sensitive to low-frequency GW (nano-Hz), usually excited by the merger of supermassive BHs which are the result of galaxy-galaxy mergers.</li>
  <li>(Submilimeter) Pulsar is the lighthouse in the universe. If the gravitational wave propagate in the direction from the pulsar to us, the period of pulsar will be slightly different. This paper analyzes the past 11-year data from 43 pulsars, and find no GW event above a certain strain.
    <blockquote>
      <p>We find that there are no SMBHBs with a chirp mass greater than <script type="math/tex">10^9</script> solar masses within a distance of 120 Mpc and none with chirp passes greater than <script type="math/tex">10^{10}</script> solar masses within 5.5 Gpc. Using this data set, the collaboration has determined that there are no SMBHBs in the Virgo Cluster with a chirp mass greater than <script type="math/tex">1.6 \times 10^9</script> solar masses emitting gravitational waves at a frequency of 9 nHz, which implies that none of the galaxies NGC 4472, NGC 4486, or NGC 4649 (which are all candidates for gravitational waves in the Virgo Cluster) could contain SMBHBs emitting gravitational waves in this frequency range.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>I know very little about this area. But it will be quite exciting if we detected the GW from SMBHs merger in the nearby galaxies.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="a-brief-history-of-gravitational-waves"><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.09400.pdf">A Brief History of Gravitational Waves</a></h3>
<ul>
  <li>The discovery of the first GW event is quite interesting and exciting. It’s worth noting that ‘inject’ events test the correct judgment of GW events.</li>
  <li>Unlike electromagnetic wave, which can be excited by electric dipole (one positive, one negative), the gravitational wave cannot be simply excited by a dipole, since there’s nothing with negative mass.</li>
  <li>Imagine we have two points A and B. We can only detect the transverse GW which is propagating perpendicular to A-B. Only this type of GW could stretch the distance between A and B. The best ‘ruler’ of measuring distance is light. The speed of light is constant and unaltered by a gravitational wave.</li>
  <li>Richard Feynmann designed a gedanken experiment to show that gravitational waves do carry energy. “I was surprised to find that a whole day of the conference was spent on this issue and that ‘experts’ were confused. That’s what happens when one is considering energy conservation tensors, etc. instead of questioning, can waves do work?”</li>
  <li>Joseph Weber designed the very first GW detector, names “Weber bar”. But limited by the suspension techniques and thermal noise isolation, Weber published wrong results of detections. This kind of intense GW comes from the central SMBH of milky way will make our galaxy disperse before we human beings exist.</li>

<ul>
  <li>The coalescences between stellar mass black holes produces GW with the amplitude of <script type="math/tex">h = 10^{-21}</script>.</li>
  <li>In designing an interferometer to detect GW, the optimal size of the arms is one-forth of the GW wavelength. (100 Hz corresponds to 750 km) Rainer Weiss came up with the idea of building an interferometer to detect GW in an undergraduate seminar on GR in MIT.</li>
  <li>Prior to LIGO, German has constructed a 600-m interferometer called GEO-600 (1994), which contributed a lot to this industry. France and Italy also built VIRGO (2003) detector at the same time with LIGO.</li>
  <li>Weiss cooperated with Thorne and Drever (both from Caltech) on building LIGO at first, but difficulties emerged between Weiss and Drever. Latter Barish took the position of Drever and became the leader of LIGO. He founded the laboratory LIGo and scientific collaboration LIGO, separately.</li>
  <li>“Initial” LIGO runs from 2002 to 2010 but got no results. But right before the official run of “Advanced” LIGO, a GW from BH-BH merger was detected by aLIGO during an experimental run. After then, more and more GWs are detected by LIGO. Weiss, Thorne and Barish were awarded 2017 Nobel Prize in Physics. The new era has come.</li>

<p>Hubble tension again. We measure <script type="math/tex">H_0</script> from different aspects, but mainly from local distance ladder and CMB. The measurement of <script type="math/tex">H_0</script> by using CMB is heavily based on <script type="math/tex">\Lambda</script>CDM model and basic physics in the early Universe. In the middle between CMB and local universe, SNe and BAO take part in. (Also notice that CMB could be used to probe all the physics from last scattering surface to today.) The determination of <script type="math/tex">H_0</script> on local universe is based on some stellar physics (Cepheids, supernovae Ia). Note that local distance measurement relies on the flatness of Euclidean space. Gravitational Wave and counterparts, time-delay lensing,</p>

<ul>
  <li>I just read this <a href="https://astrobites.org/2019/02/18/type-ia-supernovae-could-use-some-more-color/">astrobite</a> about this paper.</li>
  <li>People used to calibrate SNe Ia using color (B-V) and <script type="math/tex">m_{15}</script>. Now this paper suggest that the color of local environment of SNe (their surroundings) should also be considered as a factor of calibration. Redder color implies low SFR. Previous analyses have found that galaxies that are not forming many stars tend to host SNe Ia that are brighter than SNe Ia from very active galaxies even <em>after standardization</em>.</li>
  <li>They test the distribution of Hubble residual <script type="math/tex">\mu - \mu_{model}</script> for SNe in different local environments (different <script type="math/tex">U-V</script> color). They find significant difference (<script type="math/tex">7\sigma</script>).</li>
  <li>Hence, while calibrating things, we should not only consider the things themselves, but also the environments where they’re located.</li>

<p>Continued from the following paper, which says <script type="math/tex">r_{80}</script> may be related to galaxy halo. This paper studies this further and gets some interesting results. After reading this paper, I feel intensively that good science is linking difference fields. Dirac linked analytical mechanics (Poisson brackets) with quantum phenomena, then quantum mechanics was born. This paper superficially links the stellar mass - <script type="math/tex">r_{80}</script> size diagram with the well-known stellar mass - halo mass relation, and get some interesting (maybe wrong, maybe correct) results.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.05017v1">Miller et al. 2019</a> already shows that the stellar mass - <script type="math/tex">r_{80}</script> size diagram cannot tell the SF and passive galaxies apart. Fig. 1 shows that the median lines of stellar mass - <script type="math/tex">r_{80}</script> size diagram are like two pieces of power law. Then they fit this ‘broken power law’ and define the pivot mass <script type="math/tex">M_{p}</script>, where the line turns up a little bit.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then they find the pivot mass evolve with redshift significantly. The first slope (which is lower) changes slightly over redshift, but the second slope changes much. Actually the first slope (piece) is just composed of the passive galaxy branch, and the second slope (piece) is presented by SF galaxies.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most interestingly, they remind of the stellar mass - halo mass relation. If the x-axis is stellar mass and y-axis is halo mass, the SMHM relation resembles this stellar mass - size diagram in <script type="math/tex">r_{80}</script>. So what’s the physics behind this? First, the halo mass is proportional to the cubed virial radius <script type="math/tex">R_{vir}</script>. And if <script type="math/tex">r_{80}</script> is proportional to <script type="math/tex">R_{vir}</script>, then it’s reasonable that <script type="math/tex">r_{80}</script> is a proxy of halo mass. So they just fit this coefficient for the most nearby redshift bin and find <script type="math/tex">r_{80} = 0.047 R_{vir}</script>. Assuming this holds for all redshift ranges, they plot SMHM relation predicted by <script type="math/tex">r_{80}</script>, which is now a proxy of halo mass. They find it’s good to <script type="math/tex">z\sim 2</script>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In measuring the SMHM relation, there are many methods such as g-g lensing and clustering (which is more direct and more observational), abundance matching, and halo occupation distribution. But different methods gives different results and have different detection ability on redshift. They author also define a pivot masses for the SMHM relations and study their evolution. They don’t match with stellar mass - size one. So they suspect the intrinsic scatter may cause huge caveat when convert a halo-to-stellar relation to stellar-to-halo relation.</p>

<p>The classfication of galaxies can not only based on stellar mass - color diagram (also stellar mass - SFR diagram), bust also based on stellar mass - size diagram. In the past, people usually use the effective radius <script type="math/tex">r_{50}</script> as a proxy of galaxy size. (But I have been suspecting how well can <script type="math/tex">r_{50}</script> describe the size of a galaxy for a long time.) As a common sense, massive elliptical galaxies are more extended in the outskirts, but spirals are not. If we fit a galaxy using a single Sersic model, ellipticals tend to have larger Sersic index <script type="math/tex">n</script>. In this paper, Pieter and his collaborators check what would happen if we use <script type="math/tex">r_{20}</script> and <script type="math/tex">r_{80}</script> as proxies of galaxy sizes. And I remember that Sandy Faber talked about this quite a lot in a colloquium in KIAA.</p>
<ul>
  <li>This paper is quite straightforward. (But I didn’t dig deep into the sample selection part.) They find that if we use <script type="math/tex">r_{20}</script>, then using the stellar mass - size diagram can easily distinguish star-forming and passive galaxies apart. But using <script type="math/tex">r_{80}</script>, SF and passive behaves similarly.</li>
  <li>In this paper, authors use some new algorithms/terms in statistics: <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/diptest/">Hartigan’s dip test</a>; Gaussian mixture models; Bayesian information criterion; Ashman’s <script type="math/tex">D</script> parameter; Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. But actually these are also straightforward.</li>
  <li>They suspect <script type="math/tex">r_{20}</script> has something to do with star-forming / quenching. Since <script type="math/tex">r_{80}</script> is not very different between SF and passive galaxies, it may be related to the galaxy halo.</li>
  <li>Besides, I find that log-normal distribution is interesting, see this paper <a href="https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/51/5/341/243981">Log-normal distributions across the science: keys and clues</a>.</li>

<p>On how to measure the velocity dispersion directly from spectrum, I found a paper by Luis Ho in 2002: <a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/343840/pdf">A Study of the Direct Fitting Method for Measurement of Galaxy Velocity Dispersions</a>. The main idea in this paper is:</p>
<ul>
  <li>In measuring velocity dispersion, it’s convenient to use <script type="math/tex">x = \ln(\lambda)</script> scale, because <script type="math/tex">x' = \ln[\lambda(1+z)] = x + \ln(1+z) \approx x + z</script> for <script type="math/tex">z\ll 1</script>.</li>
  <li>Find some spectrums of stars as templates. They don’t have any velocity dispersions (or can be ignored).</li>
  <li>Assume the effect of velocity dispersion is Gaussian. Then, to get a dispersed spectrum, you should convolve the template with a Gaussian kernel with a given radius. Write this in maths, that is <script type="math/tex">T(x)]\otimes G(x, r)</script>.</li>
  <li>But we should consider that the featureless continuum components are different between template and galaxy. So we simply add a featureless continuum which is typically a straight line with <script type="math/tex">x = \ln(\lambda)</script> (in <script type="math/tex">\lambda</script> domain this is an exponential continuum). Hence: <script type="math/tex">[T(x)\otimes G(x, r)] + C(x)</script>.</li>
  <li>To compensate other effects such as reddening difference between template and galaxy, we multiply a low-order Legendre polynomial, then get the final model spectrum. That is:
<script type="math/tex">M(x) = \{[T(x)\otimes G(x, r)] + C(x)\}\sum_l P_l(x).</script></li>
  <li>Then we have several parameters, like Gaussian kernel radius, continuum straight line intercept and slope, and coefficients for every order Legendre polynomials. Note that in <script type="math/tex">\chi^2</script>, the error term contains the measurement error of galaxy spectrum, and error of template which is typically negligible. At last, let MCMC be. The radius of Gaussian kernel should be the velocity dispersion (need a conversion).</li>
</ul>

<p>Now for the NGC1052-DF2 case, Shany make a spectrum combining spectrums of all special region. And this spectrum has been broadened. Shany uses templates from two Global Clusters, say M3 and M13. The templates here has already been broadened by velocity dispersion (Gaussian). And we know the <script type="math/tex">\sigma</script> of two Gaussian obeys <script type="math/tex">\sigma_{\mathrm{star}}^2 = \sigma_{\mathrm{template}}^2 + \sigma_{\mathrm{measure}}^2</script>, where <script type="math/tex">\sigma_{\mathrm{star}}</script> is the velocity dispersion of DF2. So we can measure <script type="math/tex">\sigma_{\mathrm{measure}}</script> by the same method as stated above, and then get the velocity dispersion of DF2 <script type="math/tex">\sigma_{\mathrm{star}}</script>, which is <script type="math/tex">\sigma_{\mathrm{star}} = 8.4\pm2.1\ \mathrm{km
 s}^{-1}</script>.</p>

<p>How to calculate the dynamical mass given the velocity dispersion? I need to figure out.</p>

<p>Intrinsic shape or rotation axis (minor axis rotation.)</p>

<p>Kevin: it’s not necessarily weird that we detect a galaxy lacking dark matter in its central region. Given the large scatter of halo mass and halo concentration of a given stellar mass in the low-mass end, it’s probably that we just encountered a galaxy with low halo mass and low halo concentration.</p>
