# Lecture 1: Introduction

Precise: small scatter, but may not correct
Accurate: Correct, but may with large scatter

> How to measure the distance to the sun? 

Everything involved in the distance measurement is based on the astronomical unit AU.

Benchmark: the distance to the galactic center $R_0$

Dust attenuation must be considered in the distance measurement.

Period-Luminosity relation of Cepheids: Cepheids have different kinds (Population I and II) 

Water vapor maser frequency: 22 GHz. Maser sources are often around AGB stars. We can measure the motion of maser spots around the galactic center. This gives us the distances to galactic center using geometric method. Masers are around the AGB stars, with expansion. 

R0=8.0 kpc. (IAU recommended)
