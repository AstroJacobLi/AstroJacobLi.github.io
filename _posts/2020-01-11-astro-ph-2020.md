Again, feel very ashamed for the decadence in the past year 2019. I will try to read as many paper as possible and do my best in 2020.

### [Early-type Host Galaxies of Type Ia Supernovae. II. Evidence for Luminosity Evolution in Supernova Cosmology](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019arXiv191204903K/abstract)

- The Supernovae Cosmology (Riess, Perlmutter, Schmidt) has a fundamental assumption: the absolute magnitude of SNe Ia after standardization doesn't evolve with time. They compared nearby SNe Ia in late- and early-type galaxies, concluded no significant differences. However, recent observations have found the dependence of standardized luminosity on other factors: SN Ia is 1) brighter in ETG; 2) brighter in more massive galaxies; 3) fainter in high SFR region. However, how does these factors (SFR, mass, morphology) directly affect the progenitor of SNe Ia? We don't know.

- The authors proposed that **stellar age** and **metallicity** are the direct factors of the luminosity variation. The dependence on mass, SFR, morphology can be attributed to age and metallicity. Hence they studied ~50 ETGs, derived their stellar ages and metallicities, concluded that **SNe Ia in galaxies with older stellar population is brighter**. The correlation is significant.

- Why do we need dark energy? Because we have found that the luminosity of SNe Ia at high-z is fainter than expected, so we need dark energy to dilute the light and increase the distance. However, if SN Ia in young ETG (which is at high-z) is intrinsically fainter, then we don't need dark energy any more. In Figure 16, they showed that the (reported) luminosity evolution of SNe Ia can mimic dark energy.
