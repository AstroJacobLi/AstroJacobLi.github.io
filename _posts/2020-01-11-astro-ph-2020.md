Again, feel very ashamed for the decadence in the past year 2019. I will try to read as many paper as possible and do my best in 2020.

### [Adam Riess: The expansion of the Universe is faster than expected](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42254-019-0137-0#change-history)

- H0LiCOW is independent of Cepheids and SNe Ia, but also yields ~70 km/s/Mpc. 
- $$\Lambda CDM$$: six parameters with well-tested ansatzes. Dark energy with an equation of state lower than vacuum energy could produce stronger acceleration and explain the discrepancy, but this possibility is disfavoured by other intermediate­ redshift measurements.
- Early Dark Energy (EDE) (injected shortly before CMB) could have increased the early expansion, decreased the sound horizon, and raise the predicted $$H_0$$. But the value of EDE must be fine-tuned. Adding new particles (such as neutrino) could play the same role, but will create conflicts with CMB.

### [A parallax distance to 3C 273 through spectroastrometry and reverberation mapping](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-019-0979-5)

- New component in the cosmic distance ladder! Using GRAVITY spectroastrometry (SA) (resolution ~10 mas), they measured the angular size of the broad-line-region to be 46 mas. They also used reverberation mapping (RM) to measure the physical size of the broad-line-region. Thus a distance is derived and Hubble constant is measured as $$H_0 = 71.5^{+11.9}_{-10.6}\ \mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$$. With larger sample size, the Hubble constant can be measured to 3% precision, and help test the Hubble tension.  SARM could simultaneously measure the SMBH mass (Doppler broaden + physics size).

### [Early-type Host Galaxies of Type Ia Supernovae. II. Evidence for Luminosity Evolution in Supernova Cosmology](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019arXiv191204903K/abstract)

{% include image.html url="/images/astro-ph/Kang2019.png" caption="Luminosity evolution of SNe Ia can mimic dark energy" width=350 align="right" %}

- The Supernovae Cosmology (Riess, Perlmutter, Schmidt) has a fundamental assumption: the absolute magnitude of SNe Ia after standardization doesn't evolve with time. They compared nearby SNe Ia in late- and early-type galaxies, concluded no significant differences. However, recent observations have found the dependence of standardized luminosity on other factors: SN Ia is 1) brighter in ETG; 2) brighter in more massive galaxies; 3) fainter in high SFR region. However, how does these factors (SFR, mass, morphology) directly affect the progenitor of SNe Ia? We don't know.
- The authors proposed that **stellar age** and **metallicity** are the direct factors of the luminosity variation. The dependence on mass, SFR, morphology can be attributed to age and metallicity. Hence they studied ~50 ETGs, derived their stellar ages and metallicities, concluded that **SNe Ia in galaxies with older stellar population is brighter**. The correlation is significant. 

- Why do we need dark energy? Because we have found that the luminosity of SNe Ia at high-z is fainter than expected, so we need dark energy to dilute the light and increase the distance. However, if SN Ia in young ETG (which is at high-z) is intrinsically fainter, then we don't need dark energy any more. In Figure 16, they showed that the (reported) luminosity evolution of SNe Ia can mimic dark energy.
