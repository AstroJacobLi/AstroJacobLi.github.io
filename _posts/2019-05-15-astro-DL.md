- [PixelCNN](https://towardsdatascience.com/auto-regressive-generative-models-pixelrnn-pixelcnn-32d192911173): could complete the data (Bach's music). Neural density estimation could also generate fake video/voice/images.

## Deep learning and Astrophysics

### [Finding Strong Gravitational Lenses in the DESI DECam Legacy Survey](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.00970.pdf)

### Cluster finder (Song)

Another interesting application of deep learning would be cluster finder.  I just know that someone is working on it, but have not seen a paper.  There is a very short talk at the LSST-UK meeting now:  https://lsst-uk.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/650412049/Using_deep_learning_to_search_for_galaxy_clusters.pdf. The idea is pretty straightforward, given a training sample of galaxy clusters down to certain richness/halo mass, is there a network that can select all the clusters in another dataset?  Or even better, if the training sample comes with labels like redshift and richness, can the network predict that?
This would be a much, much more interesting application…but also it will be much more complicated.
Anyway, just another random idea I’d like to write down before I forget…
