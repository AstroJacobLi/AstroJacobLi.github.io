Wavelet: remove ridgets, 

New initialization method: starting from more compact config (for non-target galaxy), start from point source



Decision tree: model selection. Wavelet: too much freedom.

PSF: only for star

Extended source -> wavelet model



NN: select model

APQ parameterization

NN: how to combine components that are actually part of the LSBG?

NN: two components are actually one??

Shape: weighted second-order moment??
