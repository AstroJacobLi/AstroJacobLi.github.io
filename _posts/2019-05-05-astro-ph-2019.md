### [Astro2020 Science White Paper: The Local Relics of of Supermassive Black Hole Seeds](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.08670.pdf)
- We have detected supermassive BHs and stellar-mass BHs. We found a SMBH with $$M>10^9 M_\odot$$ at $$z>7$$. But we know nothing about how they form. The intermediate-mass BHs ($$100 - 10^5\ M_\odot$$) could serve as seeds for the formation of SMBH. We didn't find any IMBH so far.

- One speculation is that IMBH is in the center of GC. Taking the advantage of high resolution of next generation ground-based large telescopes (TMT, E-ELT), we could measure the proper motion of stars in the center of GCs at different epochs, then derive the mass of central BH. The existence of $$10^3\ M_\odot$$ BH could increase the central velocity dispersion by 1 km/s. 

- Another possibility is that IMBH is in the center of low-mass galaxies. Using IFU + adaptive optics on 8-10 meter telescopes, we have already made progress on the demography of SMBH. In the same way, we could measure the $$\sigma^* $$ with much higher resolution for nearly all low-mass galaxies.

### Surface Brightness Fluctuations

References: [Lecture slides of **Rolf Kudritzki**](http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/users/kud/teaching_15/10_SBF.pdf); Chapter 4.2 of Richard de Grijs book.

We always (typically) use ETG to measure surface brightness fluctuations. (Any chance that we can use UDG or disks? I remembered that one of Jenny Greene's students wrote a paper about this.) We could resolve individual stars in M32, so the Surface Brightness (SB) is fluctuating across the image. It's easy to understand that it would be very smooth if we put that galaxy to very far away.

{% include image.html url="/images/SBF.png" caption="Image reduction for SBF measurement. (Fig 4.2, de Grijs book)" width=350 align="right" %}

Given the luminosity function, we could divide stars in galaxy into several separated parts, hence $$L = \sum n_iL_i$$. Now we only focus on one part of them. Assuming the pixel scale is $$\theta$$ on the sky, the distance is $$d$$, the column density of stars is $$n_i$$, thus the number of stars you see in each pixel is $$N_i = n_i (d \theta )^2$$.  The flux we received from these stars is 

$$F_i = \frac{N_i L_i}{4\pi d^2} = \frac{n_i L_i \theta^2}{4\pi}=\mathrm{const.}$$

That is to say that surface brightness (often expressed in mag/arcsec^2) remains a constant, regardless of distance.

Assuming the Poissonian fluctuations of number of stars, we have: $$\sigma_{F_i}/F_i = 1/\sqrt{N_i}$$, thus

$$\frac{\sigma_{F_i}^2}{F_i} = \frac{F_i}{N_i} = \frac{L_i}{4\pi d^2} \propto \frac{1}{d^2}$$.

We define the surface brightness fluctuation to be $$\sigma_{F_i}^2/F_i$$, it goes as $$d^{-2}$$. 

If we consider all stellar populations: (note that $$\sigma_{F_i} = \left(\frac{\theta}{4\pi d}\right)^2 n_i L_i^2$$ )

{% include image.html url="/images/SBF_2.png" caption="Power spectrum of the image and SBF" width=350 align="right" %}

$$\sigma_F^2 = \sum \sigma_{F_i}^2 = \left(\frac{\theta}{4\pi d}\right)^2 \sum n_i L_i^2$$,

$$F = \sum F_i = \frac{\theta^2}{4\pi} \sum n_i L_i$$.

Thus $$F_{SBF} = \frac{\sigma_F^2}{F} = \frac{1}{4\pi d^2}\frac{\sum n_i L_i^2}{\sum n_i L_i} $$. As long we get $$F_{SBF}$$ for two galaxies with almost the same stellar population, we could derive the distances ratio of these two galaxies using SBF method. However, the calibration is not trivial.

How to measure the SBF? For an elliptical galaxy, first you need to fit a overall (2-D) model for the smoothed light distribution. After subtracting this model from image, the fluctuation is left. You can also normalize the fluctuation and mask out contaminations (see lower-right panel). Then you need to apply Fourier transformation to the image and derive a power spectrum. It will look like:

$$|I(k)|^2 = \sigma_{SBF}^2 P_{\mathrm{PSF}}^2(k) + \mathrm{const.}$$

The PSF term is easy to understand, since the pixels within the FWHM of PSF is kind of correlated. The constant term comes from the random fluctuations from sky, ccd bad pixels, cosmic rays, etc. (since the modulus of Fourier transform of a delta function if a constant). In the following figure, upper panel is M32 at 8 Mpc, where lower panel is NGC 3379 at 10 Mpc. The declining dashed line shows the power spectrum of PSF. Comparing both panels, the effect of $$\sigma_{SBF}^2$$ is significant, making it the good tool to indicate distance for nearby elliptical galaxies.

### CSST Workshop

The following is from the presentation of Luis Ho.

CSS will be launched in 2022, three astronauts living in orbit. Tiangong station has 39 boxes, only one of those boxes is used in applied sciences. CSST will be launched in 2024.

If you mount the telescope onto to space station, the vibration will decrease the image quality. Brilliant idea: fly the telescope in the same orbit, so that the telescope could be mounted into the CSS anytime, making changing instruments and repairs possible and feasible.

Europe will launch Euclid (2.4m, PSF = 2 arcsec), aiming at cosmology and weak lensing. US is also considering launch WFIRST (near IR), the future of it is not clear.

On the ground, we will have LSST (8m), survey in time domain. LSST and CSST is complimentary, CSST will have higher resolution.

Optical design: 离轴三反 (clear PSF, good for weak lensing).  It has almost the same number of pixels as LSST camera (largest one ever built). 

CSST Imaging: 17500 Wide mode, 255-1000nm, more than 6 filters (SED coverage, from near UV to J band), 0.15 arcsec seeing. CSST Spectroscopy: R>200 (better than typical narrow band). "Huge area, large wavelength coverage"

Sciences: Cosmology (lensing, very good photo-zs, large scale structures), AGN/Galaxies, etc.

CSST is $$7500\times 7$$ COSMOS (since COSMOS is only 1 square degree and is only in $i$ band.

**Problems**: We don't have a good team. (Euclid and WFIRST have big teams, complete docs). 

"To the zero/first/second order, CSST = HST". To do science, we don't need 17500 deg^2. "LSST = HSC".

"CSST + Euclid + WFIRST = CANDELS (many bands, near complete SED data)"

We can think about combining HSC data and their overlap with previous data.

**"What do you measure and how do you measure???"** (Tidal tails, UDGs, meters, etc.)

Best way to prepare for CSST: the only driven source is to write papers and pipelines.

- FAST has already done the first commission called CRAFTS (Commensal Radio Astronomy FAST Survey). CRAFTS observes pulsar, HI galaxy, **HI image**, fast radio burst (FRB) and other transients in radio band.
- FAST could measure the fundamental constants of nature, and explore the physics behind cosmic rays, gravitational radiation, pulsar magnetospheres, interstellar masers, etc.

### [Coordinated Assembly of Brightest Cluster Galaxies](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/aad336/meta)
Related to my ICL project.

- $$[\alpha/\rm{Fe}]$$ is used to indicate the star formation (burst) timescales. We know that after the starburst, SNe II explode promptly and produce a large amount of $$\alpha$$-elements (such as O, Ne, Mg, Si) and relatively less iron. Several time (1 Gyr) after the starburst, SNe Ia start to explode and produce a large mount of iron. 

{% include image.html url="/images/Gu_coordinated.jpg" caption="Coordinated Assembly of BCG (Gu et al. 2018a)" width=350 align="right" %}

- Observations show that massive galaxies (region) are older, more metal-rich, more $$\alpha$$-enhanced compared to low-mass galaxies. They also have higher velocity dispersion in the center. We know that low-mass galaxies are possibly the building blocks of very massive galaxies. However, these building blocks have low metallicity and low $$\alpha$$ abundance, thus they would dilute the metallicity and $$\alpha$$ abundance of massive galaxies, making it a paradox. However, the relations between $$M_*$$ and metallicity ($$\alpha$$ abundance) have large scatter. There are some low-mass galaxies which are old, metal-rich and $$\alpha$$-enhanced. Hence it seems that massive galaxies are prone to gather their building blocks which have early truncated star formation and have high $$\alpha$$ abundance. This assembly is called **Coordinated Assembly** of BCG by this paper.

- This paper utilizes MUSE IFU data to explore chemical abundances and velocity dispersions in galaxy cluster Abell 3827. In this cluster, there are several galaxies which will merge together within 1 Gyr. For these galaxies, their centers are old, have high $$[\rm{Fe/H}]$$ and anomalous high $$[\rm{\alpha/Fe}]$$. So this paper proposes that the building blocks are **environmentally quenched**. The star formation (burst) before was short, and early???


### [Spectroscopic Constraints on the Build-up of the Intracluster Light in the Coma Cluster](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.13242.pdf)
Related to my ICL project.

- Tools for studying ICL: multi-band photometry; spectroscopy; IFU; globular clusters; planetary nebulae or other individual objects; red giants branch stars.

- [`alf`](https://github.com/cconroy20/alf) (developed by [Charlie Conroy](https://scholar.harvard.edu/cconroy/projects) and [Pieter van Dokkum](https://www.pietervandokkum.com)) is able to fit a two burst star formation history, the redshift, velocity dispersion, overall metallicity [Z/H], 18 individual element abundances, several IMF parameters, and a variety of nuisance parameters. This paper uses top-hat priors for most of parameters.

- For a typical ETG, the velocity dispersion in the central region is 200-300 km/s, and the velocity dispersion in the ICL region is above 400 km/s.

{% include image.html url="/images/Gu2018.png" caption="Stellar Mass - Metallicity Relation (Gu et al. 2018b)" width=350 align="right" %}

- "Both BCG + ICL $$g-r$$ colors become bluer with increasing radius. This is consistent with our spectroscopic results that the stellar population is more metal poor with increasing radius."

- The SNR could be expressed like SNR density: in the unit of $$\mathrm{nm}^{-1}$$.

- "Both BCGs+ICL structures have rising velocity dispersion profiles, suggesting that stars in the **ICL trace the potential of the Coma cluster instead of any individual galaxy**. " "Nearly flat stellar age profiles in ETGs are observed." "The massive ETGs in the central regions of galaxy clusters grow by **accreting preferentially old stellar systems**"

- Possible mechanism of ICL: tidal disruption of dwarf galaxies; tidal striping of low mass galaxies through galaxy interactions; violent relaxiation during major mergers; in-situ star formation.

- **On the assembly of ICL.** Basically two stage formation of BCG: in-situ star formation in high-z; accretions and mergers in low-z. We already have an established relation between stellar mass and overall metallicity (MZR). More massive galaxy has higher metallicity. The metallicity of ICL here measured by MaNGA indicates that: if they comes from individual galaxies, they should come from dwarf galaxies with stellar mass $$8 < \log(M_*/M_\odot) < 9.5$$. Noticing that the metallicities of BCG outskirts are relatively low, hence another possibility is that the ICL stars come from outskirts of BCG. But they are unlikely come from the inner part of massive (both disk and ETG) galaxies (say $$\log(M_*/M_\odot) > 11$$).

### [Illuminating Low Surface Brightness Galaxies with the Hyper Suprime-Cam Survey](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018ApJ...857..104G)
> Blends of faint galaxies and/or distant galaxy groups are a major source of contamination for any deep diffuse-galaxy search (e.g., Koda et al. 2015; Sifón et al. 2018). The faintness of these sources means that they will not be masked by the previous step of our pipeline, and if detected as single objects, their sizes will be biased high and their central surface brightnesses will be biased low, making them look like the objects we are searching for.

### [Belfiore 2016: SDSS IV MaNGA – spatially resolved diagnostic diagrams: a proof that many galaxies are LIERs](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/arXiv:1605.07189)

IMPORTANT for my paper! 
- People used BPT diagram to distinguish SF galaxies with AGN galaxies. But in the past, SDSS only uses single-fibre spectrum, whose aperture typically corresponds to several kpc (also considering seeing). But to confirm AGN, you need to zoom more in to the scale of ~ 100 kpc. 
- "Heckman (1980) first presented a detailed study of LI(N)ER emission, arguing that LI(N)ERs could represent the low-luminosity extension of the Sy population. Studies of the central few parsecs in nearby galaxies (Ho, Filippenko & Sargent 1997; Shields et al. 2007) demonstrate that LINER emission on those scales can be associated with nuclear accretion phenomena, in particular weak, radiatively inefficient AGNs (see for example the review from Ho 2008). " But Belfiore argued that the H$$\alpha$$ emission luminosity excited by pAGB stars can be equal to (or brighter than) that excited by LLAGN. So pAGB can be a strong candidate.
- The demarcation line between SF and Seyfert+LINER can be derived theoretically. Here we use Kauffmann 2003 and Kewley 2001 (dotted in my plot). "The [S II] BPT diagram is not affected by the N/O abun- dance ratio, and provides a cleaner separation within the ‘right-hand sequence’ between Sy and LIERs (Kewley et al. 2006)". The demarcation line between Seyfert and LINER is from Kewley 2006.
- Stars in LINER region are typically older than other regions. Stars in LINER region with larger S[II]/H$$\alpha$$ are older.
- cLIER: central (within one PSF at least) LIER (classified by S[II] BPT); eLIER: LIER extends to one PSF at least; Seyfert: AGN within PSF; Line-less: EW[H$$\alpha$$] < 1 within $1 R_e$. 
- More cLIER and more eLIER at high mass end, more SF at low mass end.
- They study H$$\alpha$$ profile and EW profile. SF has high EW, eLIER has low EW, cLIER has low EW at center, and EW increases rapidly. 
- cLIER and eLIER are supported by pAGB star because: 1. Old stellar population; 2. low EW and flat gradient. The gradients of ionization parameters also rules out AGN as sources of eLIER.

### [HI galaxies with little star formation: an abundance of LIERs](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/485/3/3169/5368367)
- They selected 91 HI galaxies with no (or little) star formation from a HI survey. They study the IFU data of some of them, classify them into SF, Seyfert, LINER and LIER. They find most (75%) of these galaxies are LIER. 
- D4000 data implies that LIER region has an average stellar population age ~ 5 Gyrs. Given that pAGB stars come to power 2 Gyrs after the last star formation event (Belfiore 2017), this paper supports the post AGB scenario.

#### Subo Dong's talk on Supernovae

Kinetic energy is $$10^{51}$$ erg.

Radiation energy is $$10^{49}$$ erg.

10000 km/s is the typical velocity for SN explosion.

Zwicky: pioneer of searching SN.

SN1987A: in LMC, but is type II.

Gravitational binding energy: $$10^{53}$$ erg. Where has energy gone? Neutrino!

Neutrino energy: $$10^{53}$$ erg.

**We still don't know the explosion mechanism of CC SN**

Detection power: $$A(\mathrm{m}^2)\times\Omega(\mathrm{deg}^2)$$, and LSST stands out!


SNe Ia are the "main sequence" of SNe, they are regularity and continuous.

Type II and Type Ib/Ic trace star formation. Type Ia doesn't depend on environment too much.

The light of SN comes from $$^{56}\mathrm{Ni}$$ decay. Low luminosity Ia are from elliptical galaxies, on the contrast, Ia in spirals are more luminous. Every theory should be able to produce an order of magnitude difference of Nicole. 1991bg: low luminosity; 1991T: super luminosity.

We don't know how to trigger the explosion. (Maoz et al., 2014 ARAA); Duran Kushnir, Boaz Katz, Dan Maoz

Try to find close WD pairs as SN progenitors: SPY survey.

Subo: major channel WD-WD direct collision. ~ 20% WD in triples can explain the major channel of SN Ia.

Long time to produce low mass WD, thus more sub luminous Ia in ETG.

Just explode: we only see photosphere, ejecta are optical thick. With time goes on, we see deeper into that. After months, the ejecta gets nearly transparent, and turns into nebular phase.

Smoking gun paper: using cobalt line and found bimodal velocity distribution. Two chunks of Ni56! Fraction: 3/20. But viewing angle should be taking into consideration!

Non-equal mass of WD pairs leads to blueshift-redshift of cobalt lines.

Ping's new work: H$$\alpha$$ line, thin, less than 200 km/s. Maybe Ia-CSM?

### [The distance, supernova rate and supernova progenitors of NGC 6946](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.00173)
- We can estimate the SFR over the last $$\sim 100$$ Myrs using core-collapse SNe rate. This is only the lower limit of SFR since there are more missed or failed CC-SNe that we didn't see. 
- Given a SFR and metallicity, one can calculate the FUV luminosity of a galaxy. After applying extinction (both from the foreground and intrinsic) corrections and comparing it with observation, a luminosity distance can be determined.
- The distance to SN is crucial for determining the intrinsic luminosity of it. Larger distance here implies brighter/more massive progenitors. Using the new distance, two events become normal and can be explained from stellar physics models. Distances should be paid attention to!

### [The NANOGrav 11-Year Data Set: Limits on Gravitational Waves from Individual Supermassive Black Hole Binaries](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.11585)
- Just read this [astrobite](https://astrobites.org/2019/02/21/searching-for-gravitational-waves-from-binary-supermassive-black-holes-with-cosmic-lighthouses/) on this paper.
- NANOGrav project provides another approach of detecting gravitational waves. LIGO (and other ground-based experiments) is sensitive to high-frequency GW (1-1000 Hz), which is usually excited by binary BH mergers or binary NS mergers. Pulsar timing array is sensitive to low-frequency GW (nano-Hz), usually excited by the merger of supermassive BHs which are the result of galaxy-galaxy mergers.
- (Submilimeter) Pulsar is the lighthouse in the universe. If the gravitational wave propagate in the direction from the pulsar to us, the period of pulsar will be slightly different. This paper analyzes the past 11-year data from 43 pulsars, and find no GW event above a certain strain. 
> We find that there are no SMBHBs with a chirp mass greater than $$10^9$$ solar masses within a distance of 120 Mpc and none with chirp passes greater than $$10^{10}$$ solar masses within 5.5 Gpc. Using this data set, the collaboration has determined that there are no SMBHBs in the Virgo Cluster with a chirp mass greater than $$1.6 \times 10^9$$ solar masses emitting gravitational waves at a frequency of 9 nHz, which implies that none of the galaxies NGC 4472, NGC 4486, or NGC 4649 (which are all candidates for gravitational waves in the Virgo Cluster) could contain SMBHBs emitting gravitational waves in this frequency range.
- I know very little about this area. But it will be quite exciting if we detected the GW from SMBHs merger in the nearby galaxies.

### [A Brief History of Gravitational Waves](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.09400.pdf)
- The discovery of the first GW event is quite interesting and exciting. It's worth noting that 'inject' events test the correct judgment of GW events. 
- Unlike electromagnetic wave, which can be excited by electric dipole (one positive, one negative), the gravitational wave cannot be simply excited by a dipole, since there's nothing with negative mass.
- Imagine we have two points A and B. We can only detect the transverse GW which is propagating perpendicular to A-B. Only this type of GW could stretch the distance between A and B. The best 'ruler' of measuring distance is light. The speed of light is constant and unaltered by a gravitational wave.
- Richard Feynmann designed a gedanken experiment to show that gravitational waves do carry energy. “I was surprised to find that a whole day of the conference was spent on this issue and that ‘experts’ were confused. That’s what happens when one is considering energy conservation tensors, etc. instead of questioning, can waves do work?”
- Joseph Weber designed the very first GW detector, names "Weber bar". But limited by the suspension techniques and thermal noise isolation, Weber published wrong results of detections. This kind of intense GW comes from the central SMBH of milky way will make our galaxy disperse before we human beings exist.

{% include image.html url="/images/GW-spectrum.png" caption="Gravitational wave spectrum showing wavelength and frequency along with some anticipated sources and the kind of detectors one might use. Credit: NASA Goddard Space Flight Center." width=400 align="right" %}

- The coalescences between stellar mass black holes produces GW with the amplitude of $$h = 10^{-21}$$. 
- In designing an interferometer to detect GW, the optimal size of the arms is one-forth of the GW wavelength. (100 Hz corresponds to 750 km) Rainer Weiss came up with the idea of building an interferometer to detect GW in an undergraduate seminar on GR in MIT.
- Prior to LIGO, German has constructed a 600-m interferometer called GEO-600 (1994), which contributed a lot to this industry. France and Italy also built VIRGO (2003) detector at the same time with LIGO.
- Weiss cooperated with Thorne and Drever (both from Caltech) on building LIGO at first, but difficulties emerged between Weiss and Drever. Latter Barish took the position of Drever and became the leader of LIGO. He founded the laboratory LIGo and scientific collaboration LIGO, separately. 
- "Initial" LIGO runs from 2002 to 2010 but got no results. But right before the official run of "Advanced" LIGO, a GW from BH-BH merger was detected by aLIGO during an experimental run.

### [The local and distant Universe: stellar ages and $H_0$](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.07081.pdf)
Hubble tension again. We measure $$H_0$$ from different aspects, but mainly from local distance ladder and CMB. The measurement of $$H_0$$ by using CMB is heavily based on $$\Lambda$$CDM model and basic physics in the early Universe. In the middle between CMB and local universe, SNe and BAO take part in. (Also notice that CMB could be used to probe all the physics from last scattering surface to today.) The determination of $$H_0$$ on local universe is based on some stellar physics (Cepheids, supernovae Ia). Note that local distance measurement relies on the flatness of Euclidean space.

### [Dependence of Type Ia supernova luminosities on their local environment](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.07697)
- I just read this [astrobite](https://astrobites.org/2019/02/18/type-ia-supernovae-could-use-some-more-color/) about this paper.
- People used to calibrate SNe Ia using color (B-V) and $$m_{15}$$. Now this paper suggest that the color of local environment of SNe (their surroundings) should also be considered as a factor of calibration. Redder color implies low SFR. Previous analyses have found that galaxies that are not forming many stars tend to host SNe Ia that are brighter than SNe Ia from very active galaxies even _after standardization_.
- They test the distribution of Hubble residual $$\mu - \mu_{model}$$ for SNe in different local environments (different $$U-V$$ color). They find significant difference ($$7\sigma$$).
- Hence, while calibrating things, we should not only consider the things themselves, but also the environments where they're located.

### [A mass-dependent slope of the galaxy size-mass relation out to z~3: further evidence for a direct relation between median galaxy size and median halo mass, by Pieter van Dokkum group](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.05014v1)
Continued from the following paper, which says $$r_{80}$$ may be related to galaxy halo. This paper studies this further and gets some interesting results. After reading this paper, I feel intensively that good science is linking difference fields. Dirac linked analytical mechanics (Poisson brackets) with quantum phenomena, then quantum mechanics was born. This paper superficially links the stellar mass - $$r_{80}$$ size diagram with the well-known stellar mass - halo mass relation, and get some interesting (maybe wrong, maybe correct) results.

- [Miller et al. 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.05017v1) already shows that the stellar mass - $$r_{80}$$ size diagram cannot tell the SF and passive galaxies apart. Fig. 1 shows that the median lines of stellar mass - $$r_{80}$$ size diagram are like two pieces of power law. Then they fit this 'broken power law' and define the pivot mass $$M_{p}$$, where the line turns up a little bit.

- Then they find the pivot mass evolve with redshift significantly. The first slope (which is lower) changes slightly over redshift, but the second slope changes much. Actually the first slope (piece) is just composed of the passive galaxy branch, and the second slope (piece) is presented by SF galaxies.

- Most interestingly, they remind of the stellar mass - halo mass relation. If the x-axis is stellar mass and y-axis is halo mass, the SMHM relation resembles this stellar mass - size diagram in $$r_{80}$$. So what's the physics behind this? First, the halo mass is proportional to the cubed virial radius $$R_{vir}$$. And if $$r_{80}$$ is proportional to $$R_{vir}$$, then it's reasonable that $$r_{80}$$ is a proxy of halo mass. So they just fit this coefficient for the most nearby redshift bin and find $$r_{80} = 0.047 R_{vir}$$. Assuming this holds for all redshift ranges, they plot SMHM relation predicted by $$r_{80}$$, which is now a proxy of halo mass. They find it's good to $$z\sim 2$$.

- In measuring the SMHM relation, there are many methods such as g-g lensing and clustering (which is more direct and more observational), abundance matching, and halo occupation distribution. But different methods gives different results and have different detection ability on redshift. They author also define a pivot masses for the SMHM relations and study their evolution. They don't match with stellar mass - size one. So they suspect the intrinsic scatter may cause huge caveat when convert a halo-to-stellar relation to stellar-to-halo relation.

### [A New View of the Size-Mass Distribution of Galaxies: Using $r_{20}$ and $r_{80}$ instead of $r_{50}$, by Pieter van Dokkum group](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.05017v1)
The classfication of galaxies can not only based on stellar mass - color diagram (also stellar mass - SFR diagram), bust also based on stellar mass - size diagram. In the past, people usually use the effective radius $$r_{50}$$ as a proxy of galaxy size. (But I have been suspecting how well can $$r_{50}$$ describe the size of a galaxy for a long time.) As a common sense, massive elliptical galaxies are more extended in the outskirts, but spirals are not. If we fit a galaxy using a single Sersic model, ellipticals tend to have larger Sersic index $$n$$. In this paper, Pieter and his collaborators check what would happen if we use $$r_{20}$$ and $$r_{80}$$ as proxies of galaxy sizes. And I remember that Sandy Faber talked about this quite a lot in a colloquium in KIAA.
- This paper is quite straightforward. (But I didn't dig deep into the sample selection part.) They find that if we use $$r_{20}$$, then using the stellar mass - size diagram can easily distinguish star-forming and passive galaxies apart. But using $$r_{80}$$, SF and passive behaves similarly.
- In this paper, authors use some new algorithms/terms in statistics: [Hartigan's dip test](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/diptest/); Gaussian mixture models; Bayesian information criterion; Ashman's $$D$$ parameter; Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. But actually these are also straightforward.
- They suspect $$r_{20}$$ has something to do with star-forming / quenching. Since $$r_{80}$$ is not very different between SF and passive galaxies, it may be related to the galaxy halo.
- Besides, I find that log-normal distribution is interesting, see this paper [Log-normal distributions across the science: keys and clues](https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/51/5/341/243981).

### [Still Missing Dark Matter: KCWI High-Resolution Stellar Kinematics of NGC1052-DF2, by Pieter van Dokkum group](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.03711v1)
On how to measure the velocity dispersion directly from spectrum, I found a paper by Luis Ho in 2002: [A Study of the Direct Fitting Method for Measurement of Galaxy Velocity Dispersions](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/343840/pdf). The main idea in this paper is:
- In measuring velocity dispersion, it's convenient to use $$x = \ln(\lambda)$$ scale, because $$x' = \ln[\lambda(1+z)] = x + \ln(1+z) \approx x + z$$ for $$z\ll 1$$.
- Find some spectrums of stars as templates. They don't have any velocity dispersions (or can be ignored).
- Assume the effect of velocity dispersion is Gaussian. Then, to get a dispersed spectrum, you should convolve the template with a Gaussian kernel with a given radius. Write this in maths, that is $$T(x)]\otimes G(x, r)$$.
- But we should consider that the featureless continuum components are different between template and galaxy. So we simply add a featureless continuum which is typically a straight line with $$x = \ln(\lambda)$$ (in $$\lambda$$ domain this is an exponential continuum). Hence: $$[T(x)\otimes G(x, r)] + C(x)$$.
- To compensate other effects such as reddening difference between template and galaxy, we multiply a low-order Legendre polynomial, then get the final model spectrum. That is:
$$M(x) = \{[T(x)\otimes G(x, r)] + C(x)\}\sum_l P_l(x).$$
- Then we have several parameters, like Gaussian kernel radius, continuum straight line intercept and slope, and coefficients for every order Legendre polynomials. Note that in $$\chi^2$$, the error term contains the measurement error of galaxy spectrum, and error of template which is typically negligible. At last, let MCMC be. The radius of Gaussian kernel should be the velocity dispersion (need a conversion).

Now for the NGC1052-DF2 case, Shany make a spectrum combining spectrums of all special region. And this spectrum has been broadened. Shany uses templates from two Global Clusters, say M3 and M13. The templates here has already been broadened by velocity dispersion (Gaussian). And we know the $$\sigma$$ of two Gaussian obeys $$\sigma_{\mathrm{star}}^2 = \sigma_{\mathrm{template}}^2 + \sigma_{\mathrm{measure}}^2$$, where $$\sigma_{\mathrm{star}}$$ is the velocity dispersion of DF2. So we can measure $$\sigma_{\mathrm{measure}}$$ by the same method as stated above, and then get the velocity dispersion of DF2 $$\sigma_{\mathrm{star}}$$, which is $$\sigma_{\mathrm{star}} = 8.4\pm2.1\ \mathrm{km
 s}^{-1}$$.

How to calculate the dynamical mass given the velocity dispersion? I need to figure out.

Intrinsic shape or rotation axis (minor axis rotation.)

Kevin: it's not necessarily weird that we detect a galaxy lacking dark matter in its central region. Given the large scatter of halo mass and halo concentration of a given stellar mass in the low-mass end, it's probably that we just encountered a galaxy with low halo mass and low halo concentration.
