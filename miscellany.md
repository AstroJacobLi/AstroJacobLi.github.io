In my homepage, you can find more things than my research. I'm a big fan of any kinds of music, from Indian traditional tabla and sitar to Chopin and Rachmaninoff. Mordern poetry, painting and photography also fascinate me. Let's enjoy <a href="https://astrojacobli.github.io//miscellany/art/"><strong>Art</strong></a> together!

I was born in Dingxi, Gansu, which is a small city in northwest China. Sichuan dishes often appear in my meal list. Check my dishes in <a href="https://astrojacobli.github.io//miscellany/cooking/"><strong>Cooking</strong> </a>.

I also produced a short video called <strong>"_The Unknown Secrets of the Universe_ -- Astronomy in Peking University"</strong>,  which aims at showing the journey of a astronomy student at Peking University, and also conveying the spirit of PKUer. This video is made as a gift for the 120th anniversary (May 4th, 2018) of Peking University by PKU Youth Astronomy Society. Hope you like it!

I was fascinated by the beauty of the nature since I was a child. Fortunately, my parents bought me a telescope and a camera when I was 15 years old. The former makes me a (future) astronomer, and the later brings me a lot of joy.
