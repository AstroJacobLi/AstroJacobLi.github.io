<p>I am Jiaxuan Li 李嘉轩 (pronounced as <a href="https://translate.google.com/#view=home&op=translate&sl=zh-CN&tl=zh-CN&text=李嘉轩"><strong>Lǐ Jiā Xuān</strong> </a>). I am currently a senior undergraduate student in <a class="tosu" href="http://astro.pku.edu.cn ">Department of Astronomy,</a> <a class="tosu" href="http://pku.edu.cn">Peking University. </a>
<br>
<br>
I'm interested in galaxy formation and evolution, sky surveys, cosmology, supernova and data science. Currently I'm working on Hyper Suprime Camera (HSC) data to study the outskirts of massive galaxies and intra-cluster lights. I'm also developing image reduction algorithms to help people find faint low surface brightness structures around galaxies using Dragonfly data. I was working on MaNGA IFU data before to study the H-alpha ring structures of quenching spiral galaxy. I am eager to learn deep learning methods and apply them on deetcting galaxy features.

Besides, I enjoy the feeling of deriving physics formulae. I'm looking forward to chances that I can work on some theoretical problems. In the first two years of my college, I was fascinated by statistical mechanics and non-linear physics. I studied Faraday pattern on the surface of non-newton fluid using novel data processing approach.
