<p>I am Jiaxuan Li 李嘉轩 (pronounced as <a href="https://translate.google.com/#view=home&op=translate&sl=zh-CN&tl=zh-CN&text=李嘉轩"><strong>Lǐ Jiā Xuān</strong> </a>). I am currently a senior undergraduate student in <a class="tosu" href="http://astro.pku.edu.cn ">Department of Astronomy,</a> <a class="tosu" href="http://pku.edu.cn">Peking University. </a>
<br>
<br> 
My research interests focus on a variety of astrophysics and physics. My current research explores the formation and evolution of galaxies in our Universe. I'm also interested in cosmology, sky surveys and supernovae.
<br>
<br>
Other than astrophysics, I'm interested in statistical physics and nonlinear physics. I studied Faraday pattern on the surface of non-newton fluid using novel data processing approach. More things can be found in <a href="https://astrojacobli.github.io/research/"><strong>Research</strong> </a>.
<br>
<br>
In my homepage, you can find more things than my research. I'm a big fan of any kinds of music, from Indian traditional sidar and sitar to Chopin and Rachmaninoff. I am an amateur astronomer since I was in sixth grade. I took photos for a variety of objects in the sky. Check some of my collection here: <a href="https://astrojacobli.github.io//miscellany/art/"><strong>Art</strong></a>!

I was born in Dingxi, Gansu, which is a small city in northwest China. Sichuan dishes often appear in my meal list. Check my dishes in <a href="https://astrojacobli.github.io//miscellany/cooking/"><strong>Cooking</strong> </a>.
